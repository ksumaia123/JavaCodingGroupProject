    /*  A loop in programming is a control structure that repeats a block of code as long as specified condition is true. loops helps avoid writing repititive code, allowing tasks to be automated efficiently.
    * for loop- a for loop run a set of instructions for a specific no of times.
    * Exp- for(int i= 1; i<=5;i++)

    * A do while loop executes the code block at least once, even if the condition is false, because the condition is checked after the block executes.
